# Create-interactive-neural-network-visualization-using-Gradio-or-Plotly

Objective
Implement a neural network that performs the function of a logic gate (e.g., AND, OR, XOR) or classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Additionally, create a visualization interface akin to TensorFlow Playground to interact with the neural network models.

Instructions
Part 1: Neural Network Implementation
1. Choose a Task:
Option A: Implement a neural network for a logic gate (AND, OR, XOR, etc.).
Option B: Implement a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
2. Implement the Neural Network:
For Logic Gate:
Define a simple neural network model using PyTorch that can learn the logic gate function.
Prepare the dataset for the chosen logic gate.
Train the model and ensure it correctly predicts the output of the logic gate.
For MNIST:
Define a neural network model using PyTorch for classifying digits from the MNIST dataset.
Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
Train the model on the training data and evaluate it on the test data.
3. Training and Evaluation:
Define an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Train the model and ensure it achieves satisfactory performance.
Evaluate the model and report the accuracy or other relevant metrics.
Part 2: Visualization
1. Create a Visualization Interface:
Design a visualization similar to TensorFlow Playground that allows users to interact with the neural network model.
Enable users to observe how changes in hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of hidden units) affect the model’s performance.
2. Visualization Features:
For Logic Gate:

Visualize the decision boundary learned by the model.
Allow users to input different logical conditions and see the model’s predictions.
For MNIST:

Visualize the weights of the first layer and how they change during training.
Provide a way to input custom digit images and see the model’s predictions.
3. Implementation:
Use a suitable visualization library or tool (e.g., Matplotlib, Plotly, Gradio) to create the interactive visualization.
Ensure the visualization is user-friendly and informative.
